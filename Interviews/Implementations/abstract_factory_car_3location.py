From https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/abstract-factory-pattern/:

    Letâ€™s take an example, Suppose we want to build a global car factory. If it was factory oo_design pattern, then it was suitable for a single location. But for this pattern, we need multiple locations and some critical oo_design changes.

    We need car factories in each location like IndiaCarFactory, USACarFactory and DefaultCarFactory. Now, our application should be smart enough to identify the location where it is being used, so we should be able to use appropriate car
    factory without even knowing which car factory implementation will be used internally. This also saves us from someone calling wrong factory for a particular location.

    Here we need another layer of abstraction which will identify the location and internally use correct car factory implementation without even giving a single hint to user. This is exactly the problem, which abstract factory pattern is used to solve.
    Somewhat the above example is also based on How the Cabs like uber and ola functions on the large scale.

Client code:
All these builds should be based on location:
    CarFactory.build_car(CarType.MICRO)
    CarFactory.build_car(CarType.MINI)
    CarFactory.build_car(CarType.LUXURY)
