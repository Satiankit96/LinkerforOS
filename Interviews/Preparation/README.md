<u>From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns:</u>

### Creational[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Design_Patterns&action=edit&section=12)]

Main article: [Creational pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creational_pattern)

[Creational patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creational_pattern) are ones that create objects, rather than having to instantiate objects directly. This gives the program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given case‚ÅÑ

-   [x] [Abstract factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_factory_pattern) groups object factories that have a common theme.
-   [x] [Builder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern) constructs complex objects by separating construction and representation.
-   [x] [Factory method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern) creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.
-   [x] [Prototype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_pattern) creates objects by cloning an existing object.
-   [x] [Singleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern) restricts object creation for a class to only one instance.

### Structural[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Design_Patterns&action=edit&section=13)]

These concern class and object composition. They use inheritance to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.

-   [x] [Adapter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern) allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping its own interface around that of an already existing class.
-   [x] [Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_pattern) decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
-   [x] [Composite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern) composes zero-or-more similar objects so that they can be manipulated as one object.
-   [ ] [Decorator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern) dynamically adds/overrides behaviour in an existing method of an object.
-   [x] [Facade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern) provides a simplified interface to a large body of code.
-   [x] [Flyweight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyweight_pattern) reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects.
-   [x] [Proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_pattern) provides a placeholder for another object to control access, reduce cost, and reduce complexity.

### Behavioral[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Design_Patterns&action=edit&section=14)]

Most of these design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between **objects**.

-   [x] [Chain of responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain-of-responsibility_pattern) delegates commands to a chain of processing objects.
-   [x] [Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern) creates objects which encapsulate actions and parameters.
-   [x] [Interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_pattern) implements a specialized language.
-   [x] [Iterator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator_pattern) accesses the elements of an object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
-   [ ] [Mediator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediator_pattern) allows [loose coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling) between classes by being the only class that has detailed knowledge of their methods.
-   [ ] [Memento](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_pattern) provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state (undo).
-   [x] [Observer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) is a publish/subscribe pattern which allows a number of observer objects to see an event.
-   [ ] [State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern) allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
-   [x] [Strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern) allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at runtime.
-   [ ] [Template method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern) defines the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract class, allowing its subclasses to provide concrete behavior.
-   [ ] [Visitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern) separates an algorithm from an object structure by moving the hierarchy of methods into one object.
